i am sending this complaint to equifax regarding inaccurate data reported on my credit file that has not been validated certified as accurate or physically verified i have noticed potentially erroneous and highly questionable remarks on my credit report that were neither verified as a consumer i have the right to request that you remove these entries immediately in accordance with my federal and state consumer rights this complaint is also a check to ensure the items you report comply with facta title 1 section 151 which clearly outlines the procedures to be followed

kindly address this issue on my credit report i assert that this account is not mine and believe it to be fraudulent i urge you to correct this mistake and have provided supporting documents for verification

this cfpb complaint has been filed to request pursuant to fcra 605b 15 u s c 1681c 2 that you credit reporting agency block information appearing on my consumer credit report that is the result of identity theft and fraud within 4 business days of you receiving this complaint i am concerned about the validity and accuracy of your recent investigation of these accounts that are reporting on my credit report last month i requested an investigation because i felt the item was not being reported legally couple of days ago i received a letter stating that you have ceased investigation of my credit reports because in your opinion you believe that i have used a third party credit repair agency not only do i believe this to be a stall tactic on your part to grant you an additional 30 days to comply with my original request but i believe it to be a blatant violation of the fcra i have attached a copy of my government issued id as well as mail showing proof of address so there shouldnt be any confusion or stall tactics on your end i have maintained a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the ftc should you continue in your non compliance
